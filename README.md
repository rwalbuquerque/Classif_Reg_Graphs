# Scripts_R_classif_reg_Graphs

I used some of these scripts in my academic papers:

Automatic tree count in the Amazon: https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/juvs-2019-0024

Automatic measurement of canopy cover, canopy height, grass cover and satistical analysis: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/12/2401

Regression analysis to estimate species diversity: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/4/830

The results of some scripts are not published anywhere, but they some specific general operations that can be consulted.
